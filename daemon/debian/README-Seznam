$Id$

This is directory describing how to pack szn-picturedetector-daemon.

The following files can occur here:

changelog
    Essential file containing log of changes. Used to determine maintainer and
    version of the package going to be build. Also helps keeping track of
    changes between versions (its original purpose).

contest
    Rules for content testing. First column is directory, next columns contain
    regular expressions the file must not contain. Note: shell escaping takes
    place before generating regexes, so regex escapes must be doubled.

control
    Debian control file describing the source and the package(s) to be built.

prepare
    Script called before building but after packing the source. Useful for
    automatic generation of package(s) descriptions in control file and
    package(s) specific files (via szn-buildtemplate). Can be omitted.

rules
    Makefile for building the package(s). Special configuration flags can be
    specified in `DEB_CONFIGURE_USER_FLAGS'.

<package>.conffiles
    List of all configuration files. All files in `/etc' and all matching the
    regular expression `/www/.*/conf/.*\.conf' are listed automatically.

<package>.cron.(d|hourly|daily|mothly|weekly)
    Cron script(s). Omit if not used.

<package>.dirs
    List of empty directories to be created. Directories that won't be empty
    can be omitted as they will be created anyway. Can be omitted.

<package>.init
    Script for `/etc/init.d'. Omit if the package does not have one. It is
    NOT installed automatically.

<package>.install
    List of files to be installed in format $source $place.

<package>.links
    List of links to be created in format $target $place. Can be omitted.

<package>.logrotate
    Logrotate script. Omit if the package does not have logs.

<package>.manpages
    List of manual pages for that package (installation directory guessed
    automatically).  Can be omitted.

<package>.postinst
    Postinstallation script. Installation of the init script (if there's one)
    should go here under `configure'. Can be omitted (but required by PUT).

<package>.postrm
    Postremoval script. If there's init script, removal of it in the case of
    purging is automatically appended. Can be omitted (but required by PUT).

<package>.preinst
    Preinstallation script. Can be omitted (but required by PUT).

<package>.prerm
    Preremoval script. If there's init script, stopping the service in the case
    of removal (not upgrade) is automatically appended. Can be omitted (but
    required by PUT).

<package>.supervisor
    Autodescriptor for supervisor. It is copied to the proper location.

<package>.templates
    Templates for debconf. If you do not know what this means, omit it.
